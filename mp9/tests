 * You can add new test cases by adding new elements to the following lists
 * Format is:
 * TESTRUN(<weight>, <f_label>, <solution_f>, <student_f>, <program>)
 * TESTFUN(<weight>, <f_name>, <args>)
 *
 * <args> should be a space-separated list NOT surrounded by parentheses,
 *   and is simply appended to the end of <f_name>
 * <prog_args> should be of type (Minijavaast.exp list).
 **************************************************************************)

(* Test cases should go in this list. 
 * The first element of the pair is the weight of the case,
 * and the second is the string to be given to the parser.
